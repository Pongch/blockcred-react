http://blockcred.surge.sh/

## Goal
Trustless, Decentralized and immutable Micro-credential Platform. Using proof of existence, it allows any organization to register themselves and issue out credentials, diplomas, certificates for anybody on the Ethereum Blockchain. Solving the issues of Academic and Credential Fraud (costing Millions of dollars globally every year) and reducing the frictions brought by traditional paper-based and Silo'd Credentials database that could take weeks of effort to verify.

## Features

- Anybody can query an existence of a certificate based on a unique ID, and has the ability to cross reference the issuer's public key to a smart contract that holds the record of registered organization

- Anyone with an Ethereum Key pair can register themselves on the contract as an organization

- All Organization's Public Address is cross-verifiable

- Anyone can register a certificate on the blockchain

## Technology:

- Deployed on Ethereum Rinkeby testnet

- Smart Contract written with Solidity

- Client-Side Interface built with ReactJS and Web3js

- IPFS Distributed Files Storage for Image assets


## To-do:

- Get an Ethereum Domain Name (.eth)

- Deploy to Ethereum Mainnet

- Run Integration Tests on React App and Smart Contract

- Improve load time & Caching Mechanisms on IPFS gateway

- Notifications after successful API calls
